 <p> Zahir is one of the best drivers that ever lived. He actually learnt to drive when he was 12, but got his liscence at 17. He has 3 cars in his private garage and goes on night races every weekend at 10pm. He wins every race, even when the other driver has a better car. He also owns a car dealership where he rents out and sells supercars to the most elite. He has links to all the top end car manufacturers.</p>
